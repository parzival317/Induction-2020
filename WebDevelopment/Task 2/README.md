  JavaScript is really important for both front-end and back-end development. So, make sure you learn all the concepts well.
  Also, give special emphasis to learning about functions and OOP concepts in JavaScript. Using JavaScript, you can add 
  functionality to your page so that your web page can actually do stuff. Sounds interesting? Let's get started.
    

2. After learning basic JavaScript, here is your task to implement the knowledge.
  You must have seen websites with light and dark modes where you can switch between them. Your task is to make something similar. 
  A webpage with a button which, when clicked, will change the background colour from white to black or from black to white. The sample
  images are given in the same folder for you to look at.
  Try to include comments in your code so that it will be easier for us to understand what you did. You can modify the webpage in any way you want.
  Make sure you have the basic functionality in your webpage that we require. 
  Hint: Search for eventListeners, functions and changing background colour in JS.
  
 
3. If you've successfully created the webpage using JavaScript, great job! You're doing great so far. Your final task is hosting this
webpage on github. Google it. Find everything you can about it. After hosting, your URL will be free to be shared with anyone you want. 


Structure of submitting your task:

Create a folder of your name containing your HTML, JavaScript and CSS(if used) files. It should also contain the screenshots of your 
webpage in light and dark modes. Also inculde an extra txt file containing the URL of your webpage hosted on github. Finally commit your changes
and create a pull request in the Task 2 folder. :)
