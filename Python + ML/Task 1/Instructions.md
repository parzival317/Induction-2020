3. Go through the videos listed in the `Readme` and get your self familiar with the python syntax.
4. You are required to make a `jupyter notebook` for this purpose. Name your notebook as you `<Your_name>.ipynb` and put your notebook inside the folder of your name. Your notebook inside the folder should look like `Induction-2020/ Python + ML/ Task1/ <Your_Name>/ <Your_name>.ipynb`.
5. Inside the jupyter notebook you should write about the syntax of python, data types, methods ,etc and provide suitable examples for them. No need to write elaborately, just be to the point. Keep your code examples and markdown separate in their respective cells.
Refer to this notebook to get started: <a href ="https://github.com/EnigmaVSSUT/Induction-2020/tree/master/Python%20%2B%20ML/Task%201/Partha%20Prateem%20Patra">Sample Notebook</a>
6. Your notebook should contain examples dealing with:
* Variables
* Print Statement
* Data types and Type Casting
* Strings and String Formating
